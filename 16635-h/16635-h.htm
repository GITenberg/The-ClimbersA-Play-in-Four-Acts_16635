<h2>ACT I</h2>


<p class="direction"><i>A drawing-room at the Hunters', handsomely and
artistically furnished. The woodwork and
furniture are in the period of Louis XVI.
The walls and furniture are covered with
yellow brocade, and the curtains are of the
same golden material. At the back are two
large windows which give out on Fifth Avenue,
opposite the Park, the trees of which are seen
across the way. At Left is a double doorway,
leading into the hall. At Right, opposite, is a
door which leads to other rooms, and thence to
other parts of the house. In the centre, at back,
between the two windows, is the fireplace; on the
mantel are two vases and a clock in dark blue
ormolu. There is a white and gold piano on
the Right side of the room. The room suggests
much wealth, and that it has been done by a
professional decorator; the personal note of taste
is lacking.</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i>It is four o'clock in the afternoon. The shades of
the windows are drawn down. There are rows
and rows of camp-chairs filling the entire room.</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i>The curtain rises slowly. After a moment,</i>
<span class="smcap">Jordan</span>, <i>the butler, and</i> <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>, <i>a footman,
enter from the Left and begin to gather
together and carry out the camp-chairs. They
do this with very serious faces, and take great
pains to step softly and to make no noise. They
enter a second time for more chairs.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>. [<i>Whispers to</i> <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>.] When are
they coming for the chairs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. [<i>Whispers back.</i>] To-night. Say, it
was fine, wasn't it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>. Grand!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They go out with the chairs and immediately
re&euml;nter for more. They are followed in this
time by a lady's maid,</i> <span class="smcap">Tompson</span>; <i>she is not a
young woman. As she crosses the room she
stoops and picks up a faded flower which has
fallen from some emblem. She goes to the
window at Right, and peeps out. She turns
around and looks at the others. They all
speak in subdued voices.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. Jordan, what do you think&mdash;can
we raise the shades now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>. Yes, of course&mdash;after they've left
the house it's all over as far as we here are concerned.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She raises both shades.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. Phew! what an odor of flowers!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She opens one of the windows a little.</i></p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Marie</span>, <i>a young, pretty, French woman, enters
from the Right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span>. Will I help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. Just with this table, thank you,
Marie. [<i>They begin to rearrange the room, putting
it in its normal condition. They replace the
table and put back the ornaments upon it.</i>] Poor
Mr. Hunter, and him so fond of mince pie. I
shall never forget how that man ate mince pie.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She sighs lugubriously and continues her labor
with the room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. I hope as how it's not going to make
any difference with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>. [<i>Pompously.</i>] Of course not; wasn't
Mr. Hunter a millionnaire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. Some millionnaires I've known
turned out poor as Job's turkey in their coffins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span>. What you say? You tink we shall
'ave some of madame's or ze young ladies' dresses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. [<i>Hopefully.</i>] Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span>. I 'ave already made my choice. I
like ze pale pink of Mees Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. Sh! I heard a carridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompson</span>. Then they're coming back.</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Marie</span> <i>quickly goes out Right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>, <i>hurriedly, as he quickly
goes out Left.</i>] Take them last two chairs!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Leonard</span>, <i>with the chairs, follows</i> <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> <i>out
Left.</i> <span class="smcap">Tompson</span> <i>hastily puts back a last arm-chair
to its usual position in the room and goes
out Right.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span> <i>enters Left, followed
by her three daughters</i>, <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, <span class="smcap">Jessica</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Master Sterling</span>, <i>who is
a small, attractive child, five years of age.
All are in the deepest conventional mourning,</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span> <i>in widow's weeds and</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>
<i>with a heavy, black chiffon veil; the</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>is
also dressed in conventional mourning. As soon
as they enter, all four women lift their veils.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span> <i>is a well-preserved woman, with
a pretty, rather foolish, and somewhat querulous
face. Her figure is the latest mode.</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche
Sterling</span>, <i>her oldest daughter, is her antithesis,&mdash;a
handsome, dignified woman, young, sincere,
and showing, in her attitude to the others and
in her own point of view, the warmth of a
true, evenly-balanced nature.</i> <span class="smcap">Jessica</span> <i>is a
typical second child,&mdash;nice, good, self-effacing,
sympathetic, unspoiled.</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>is her opposite,&mdash;spoiled,
petulant, pretty, pert, and selfish.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>With a long sigh.</i>] Oh, I am so
glad to be back home and the whole thing over
without a hitch!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She sinks with a great sigh of relief into a big
chair.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>Takes her son to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>.]
Kiss grandmother good-by, and then Leonard
will take you home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Good-by, dear. Be a good boy.
Don't eat too much candy.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Kisses him carelessly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Master Sterling</span>. Good-by. [<i>Runs towards
the door Left, shouting happily.</i>] Leonard! Leonard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>Tearfully.</i>] My dears, it was
a great success! Everybody was there!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The three younger women stand and look about
the room, as if it were strange to them&mdash;as if
it were empty. There is a moment's silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>Tenderly.</i>] Mother, why don't you
take off your bonnet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Take it off for me; it <i>will</i> be a
great relief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Help me, Jess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>Irritably.</i>] Yes, <i>do</i> something,
Jessie. You've mortified me terribly to-day!
That child hasn't shed a tear. People'll think
you didn't love your father. [<i>The two are taking
off</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter's</span> <i>bonnet.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>
<i>waits for an answer from</i> <span class="smcap">Jessica</span>; <i>none comes.</i>]
I never saw any one so heartless! [<i>Tearful again.</i>]
And her father adored her. <i>She</i>

This funeral is enough, with its show and worldliness!
I don't believe there was a soul in the church
you didn't see! Look at your handkerchief!
Real grief isn't measured by the width of a black
border. I'm ashamed of you, Florence! I never
liked you very much, although I tried to for your
husband's sake, but now I'm even more ashamed of
you. My dear brother is gone, and there need
be no further bond between us, but I want you to
understand the true reason why, from to-day, I
keep away from you. This funeral was revolting
to me!&mdash;a show spectacle, a social function, and
for <i>him</i> who you know <i>hated</i> the very thing.
[<i>She stops a moment to control her tears and her
anger.</i>] I saw the reporters there, and I heard
your message to them, and I contradicted it. I
begged them not to use your information, and they
were gentlemen and promised me not to. You are,
and always have been, a silly, frivolous woman.
I don't doubt you loved your husband as much
as you could any man, but it wasn't enough for me;
he was worth being adored by the best and noblest
woman in the world. I've stood by all these
years, trying with my love and silent sympathy to
be some comfort to him&mdash;but I saw the disappointment
and disillusionment eat away the very
<i>hope</i> of happiness out of his heart. I tried to help
him by helping you in your foolish ambitions,
doing what I could to give my brother's wife the
social position <i>his name</i> entitled her to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. That's not true; I've had to
fight it out all alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. It was not my fault if my best friends
found you intolerable; <i>I</i> couldn't blame them.
Well, now it's over! George is at rest, please
God. You are a rich woman to do what you
please. Go, and do it! and Heaven forgive you
for ruining my brother's life! I'm sorry to have
said all this before your children. Blanche, you
know how dearly I love you, and I hope you have
forgiven me by now for my opposition to your
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Of course I've forgiven you, but
you were always unjust to Dick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Yes; I didn't like your husband then,
and I didn't believe in him, but I like him better
now. And I am going to put all my affairs in his
hands. I couldn't show&mdash;surely&mdash;a better proof
of confidence and liking than that: to trust him as
I did&mdash;your father. I hope I shall see much of
you and Jessica. As for you, Clara, I must be

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. I mean just that.</p>

died, and told me things had gone badly with him
last year, but it seemed impossible to retrench
his expenses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. <i>Are you listening, Florence?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Yes, of course I am; your
brother was a very extravagant man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. This year, with his third daughter
coming out, there was need of more money than
ever. He was harassed nearly to death with
financial worries. [<span class="smcap">Ruth</span> <i>begins to cry softly.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span> <i>gets angrier and angrier.</i>] And
finally, in sheer desperation, and trusting to the
advice of the Storrings, he risked everything he
had with them in the Consolidated Copper.
The day after, he was taken ill. You know what
happened. The Storrings, Hunter, and others
were ruined absolutely; the next day Hunter
died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Poor George! Why didn't he come to
me; he must have known that everything I had
was his!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. He was too ill when the final blow

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>To her mother.</i>] Don't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. By whom were the arrangements for

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. My son-in-law had most pressing

saw to everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. He will be here any moment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. When he comes, will you send him on
to me, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Very well. Good-by. [<i>Shakes hands

the bearer of such bad news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>Shaking hands with him.</i>]
Please overlook anything I may have said; at such
a moment, with the loss of all my money&mdash;and
my dear husband&mdash;I don't know <i>what</i> to say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Naturally. [<i>To the others.</i>] Good-by.

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> So do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. My children work! Don't be

Blanche?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Huh! Why, you could never
even learn to play the piano; I don't think you'd
be much good at typewriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. You want to be a typewriter, because
in the papers they always have an old gentleman

<p><span class="smcap">Jessica</span>. There are lots of ways nowadays for
women to earn their living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. If we only knew some nice elderly

a godsend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. If she was a nice <i>old</i> lady with lots of
money and delicate health, I wouldn't mind that
position myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Clara, you seem to take this matter
as a supreme joke!</p>

Europe is the place for you. I don't believe all
the titles are gobbled up yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Jess, I might get you some women
friends of mine, to whom you could go mornings
and answer their letters.</p>

of bread and butter, a practical suggestion of
life, which has nothing whatever to do with the
society columns of the daily papers?</p>

has been&mdash;what shall we call it&mdash;criminally

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Or&mdash;let out floors to one or two

a woman, even a happily married woman like me&mdash;[<i>This
is spoken with a slight effort, as if
she is persuading herself that she is a happily
married woman.</i>]&mdash;to have an honest friend like
you. It's those people who have failed that say
there is no such thing as a platonic friendship.</p>

turns.</i>] Shall I bring that Russian pianist around
to play for you some day next week?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Do&mdash;I want some music.</p>

Lists of bonds. [<i>She opens and looks at

This, Mr. Mason will understand better than I.
[<i>She puts it back in the pocket case. She finds a
photograph in the case.</i>] My picture!&mdash;[<i>She looks
for others, but finds none.</i>]&mdash;and <i>only</i> mine! Oh,
father!... [<i>She wipes away tears from her eyes
so as to see the picture, which is an old one.</i>]
Father, I returned <i>your</i> love. [<i>She reads on the
back of photograph.</i>] "Blanche, my darling
daughter, at fourteen years of age!" That's
mine! that's my own! [<i>And she puts the picture
away separately. She takes up a small packet of
very old love-letters tied with faded old pink tape.</i>]
Old letters from mother; they must be her love-letters.
She shall have them,&mdash;they may soften her.
[<i>She takes up a slip of paper and reads on the outside.</i>]
This is something for Mason, too. [<i>She puts
it back in the case. She takes up a sealed envelope,
blank.</i>] Nothing on it, and sealed. [<i>She looks at it a
moment, thinking.</i>] Father, did you want this
opened? If you didn't, why not have destroyed
it? Ah! I needn't be afraid; <i>you</i> had nothing to
hide from the world. [<i>Tearing it open, she reads.</i>]
"I have discovered my son-in-law, Richard Sterling,
in irregular business dealing. He is not honest.
I will watch him as long as I live; but when you
read this, Mason, keep your eye upon him for my
daughter's sake. He has been warned by me&mdash;he
may never trip again, and her happiness lies
in ignorance." [<i>She starts, and looks about
her to make sure she is alone. She then sits staring
ahead for a few seconds; then she speaks.</i>]
My boy's father dishonest! Disgrace&mdash;he owned
it&mdash;threatening <i>my</i> boy! It mustn't come!
It mustn't! <i>I'll</i> watch now. [<i>She goes to the fireplace,
tearing the paper as she crosses the room,
she burns the letter; then she gathers up the other
letters and the pocket case.</i>] He must give me his
word of honor over Richard's little bed to-night
that he will do nothing to ever make the boy
ashamed of bearing his father's name!</p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>


<p class="direction"><i>Christmas Eve; fourteen months later; the
dining room of the Hunters' house, which is
now lived in jointly by the</i> <span class="smcap">Sterlings</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span> <i>and her daughters. It is
a dark wainscoted room, with curtains of
crimson brocade. It is decorated with laurel
roping, mistletoe, and holly, for Christmas.
It is the end of a successful dinner
party, fourteen happy and more or less
congenial persons being seated at a table, as
follows:</i> <span class="smcap">Warden, Ruth, Mason, Clara,
Trotter, Mrs. Hunter, Blanche, Sterling,
Miss Sillerton, Mr. Godesby, Jessica,
Doctor Steinhart</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Godesby.</span> <i>The
room is dark on all sides, only a subdued light being
shed on the table by two large, full candelabra
with red shaded candles. As the curtain rises
the bare backs of the three women nearest the
footlights gleam out white. Candied fruit and
other sweetmeats are being passed by four men
servants, including</i> <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. My dear Blanche, what delicious candy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sillerton</span>. Isn't it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Half of the candy offered one
nowadays seems made of <i>papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>.] Julia,
do tell me how Mr. Tomlins takes his wife's
divorce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. He takes it with a grain of salt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. But isn't he going to bring a
counter suit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. I hope not. I am an old-fashioned
woman and don't believe in divorce!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Really! But then you're not
married!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sillerton</span>. What is the reason for so
much divorce nowadays?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. Marriage is the principal one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. <i>I</i> don't believe in divorce, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sillerton</span>. My dear, no woman married
to as handsome a man as Mr. Sterling would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. You people are all out of date!
More people get divorced nowadays than get
married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Too many people do&mdash;that's the
trouble. I meant what I said when I was married&mdash;"for
better, for worse, till death us do part."&mdash;What
is the opera Monday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Something of Wagner's. He's a
Dodo bird! Bores me to death! Not catchy
enough music for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. You'd adore him if you went
to Bayreuth. Which was that opera, Clara, we
heard at Bayreuth last summer? Was it <i>Faust</i>
or <i>Lohengrin</i>! They play those two so much
here I'm always getting them mixed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sillerton</span>. Wagner didn't write <i>Faust</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Didn't he? I thought he had;
he's written so many operas the last few seasons!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. I like <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>, because as soon
as you hear the "twinkle, twinkle, little stars"
song, you can cheer up and think of your wraps
and fur boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. My favorite operas are <i>San Toy</i>
and the <i>Roger Brothers</i>, though I saw <i>Florodora</i>
thirty-six times!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Mother would have gone with you
every one of those thirty-six <i>Florodora</i> times.
She's not really fond of music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Not fond of music! Didn't
I have an opera box for four years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Why doesn't Conried make some
arrangement with Weber and Fields and introduce
their chorus into <i>Faust</i> and <i>Carmen</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Steinhart</span>. Great idea! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Godesby</span>.] Did you get a lot of jolly
presents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Not half bad, especially two
fine French bulls!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>All are laughing and talking together.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. What did you get, Mr. Warden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Three copies of "David Harum,"
two umbrellas, and a cigar case too short for
my cigars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby.</span> Give it to me for cigarettes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden.</span> It's too long for cigarettes. Then I
had something that's either a mouchoir or a handkerchief
case, or for neckties, or shaving papers,
or something or other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span> Yes, I know, I got one of those, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Steinhart.</span> So did I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. And up there they're discussing
Jeffreys and Fitzsimmons.</p>

customer who can show a profit after three consecutive
years of speculation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. No, not for over a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Then you can't tell me how deep he
is in this Hudson Electric swindle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Is he in it at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Yes, he says, deep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I suspected it yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. But what with&mdash;his wife's money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. That went fourteen months ago. I
put him on his feet then, gave him some
tips that enabled him to take this house with
her mother, so that with his regular law business
he ought to have done very well, but
his living could not leave one cent over to
speculate with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. [<i>To himself.</i>] Good God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I know what you're afraid of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Yes. The reason I'm no longer
his broker is he was ashamed to let me know
about his dealings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. But you don't mean you think he'd
actually <i>steal</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. His <i>aunt's</i> money? Why not? <i>He
did his wife's!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Does he handle any one else's affairs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I know he takes care of that Godesby
woman's property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. And she wouldn't hold her tongue if
a crash came!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Not for a minute! Is Miss Hunter
suspicious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Yes. Does Sterling realize that to-morrow
he will most probably be a ruined cheat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Very likely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. If he made up his mind to-night it
was all up with him, he might do&mdash;what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Run away with whatever money he
has left, or kill himself. I don't know if he's
enough of a coward for that or not. There's <i>one</i>
hold on him&mdash;he loves his wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Which will make him all the more
ashamed of discovery. Do you believe she
suspects?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Not a bit. She loves him too
dearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Can <i>we</i> do anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Nothing but watch him closely till
the people go. Then force him to make a clean
breast of it, so we can all know where we stand;
how we can best protect his aunt from ruin and
his wife and boy from public disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. He is watching us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. He knows I know him; we must be
careful. He's coming toward us. [<i>He then speaks
in a different tone, but no louder.</i>] You're certain of
the trustworthiness of your information?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Absolutely. Every man left in that
concern will be ruined before the 'Change closes
after to-morrow. [<span class="smcap">Sterling</span> <i>has joined them in

What is this Aunt Ruth has been telling me about
not being able to get some bonds from you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Oh, nothing. I forgot to send them
up to her, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. But she says she sent three times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. One time too late to get into the
vault; and the other, her letter was mislaid&mdash;I
mean not given to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. You haven't broken your word to
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. What if I had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. I would let the law take its course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. You must love me very little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. I <i>live</i> with you. First you robbed
me of my respect for you; then you dried up my
heart with neglect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. And our boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Your blood runs in his veins; your
shame and disgrace would be a fearful warning to
him. It might kill <i>me</i>; but never mind, if it
<i>saved him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Oh, well, I haven't broken my word!
So you needn't worry. I've been honest enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>With a long sigh of relief.</i>] Oh!

a dinner party any more without you to chaperone,
Mrs. Hunter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Mother, how can you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. Oh, I don't know as it's <i>chaperoning</i>!
I like Mr. Trotter very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sillerton</span>. But he's such a little cad.
I tried to give him a lift, but he was too heavy for
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. Oh, well, you ought just to pretend it's
the money in his pocket makes him so heavy;
then you'd find him dead easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Oh, that present has almost been
my death! Men are so hard to find things for!
I had put in a gold pencil for his key chain, but
to-night while we were eating our oysters, I saw
him show a beauty that his mother had given him
this morning! So I whispered to Jordan between
the soup and fish to change Mr. Ryder's name to
Mr. Trotter's stocking, and put Mr. Trotter's
name on the one that had a cigarette case in it.
I sneaked a message down to Dick on my dinner
card&mdash;was it all right?&mdash;and he sent back word
during the game that Trotter only smoked cigars; so
before the ices were passed I shuffled Mr. Trotter's
and Mr. Mason's names,&mdash;I'd given Mason the
cigar case,&mdash;and just as Jordan signalled to me the
transfer had been successfully effected, I heard
Trotter casually observe he'd been obliged to
give up smoking entirely&mdash;<i>doctor's orders</i>!</p>

"informal little dinners."</p>

dinner table for him!</p>

him I was really ashamed to go home with my
dinner favor&mdash;it was so gorgeous! And there
were such big bunches of violets in the finger
bowls there wasn't room for your little finger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. You never saw such a lot of
decoration! The game have ribbon garters on
their legs, and even the raw oysters wear corsage
bouquets! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter.</span>] I hope you don't
mind what we're saying, Mrs. Hunter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hunter</span>. [<i>Offended.</i>] I must say I do

on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. It began fourteen months ago,
after Ned Warden put me on my feet; I got a
little ahead&mdash;why not get way ahead? There were
plenty of men around me making their fortunes!
I wanted to equal them&mdash;climb as high as they;
it seemed easy enough for them, and luck had
begun to come my way. We're all climbers of
some sort in this world. I was a climber after
wealth and everything it brings&mdash;</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He stops a moment.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>Her voice comes throbbing with
pathetic emotion through the darkness.</i>] And <i>I</i>
after <i>happiness</i> and all it brings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. [<i>Deeply moved, his voice trembles for
a moment, but only for a moment.</i>] Don't, Blanche,
or I can't finish. Well, I borrowed on some of
Aunt Ruth's bonds and speculated&mdash;I made a
hundred thousand in a week! I put back the
bonds. But it had been so easy! I could see
those bonds grinning at me through the iron side
of the vault box. They seemed to smile and beckon,
to <i>beg</i> me to take them out into the air again!
They grew to be like living things to me, servants
of mine to get me gold&mdash;and finally I determined
to make one bigger coup than ever! I took
Aunt Ruth's bonds out and all the money available
in my trust, and put it <i>all</i> into this new company!
It seemed so safe. I stood to be a prince among
the richest! And, for a day or so, I've known
nothing short of a miracle could save me from
being wanted by the police! To-night I gave up
even the miracle. That's all. It's no use saying
I'm sorry.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>A moment's pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Have others suffered besides Miss
Hunter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. There is some money of Aunt
Ruth's left&mdash;stock I couldn't transfer. But I
used the money of others&mdash;Miss Godesby and
Ryder's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Miss Ruth, a large part of your fortune
is gone, used unlawfully by this man. Will
you resort to the law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. [<i>Very quietly.</i>] No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>In a voice broken with emotion and

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. We can't hope Miss Godesby and
Ryder will be as lenient! You must go to them
in the morning&mdash;tell them everything, put yourself
at their mercy, ask for time and their
silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. <i>Never!</i> I couldn't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. It is the only honorable way out of your
dishonorable action&mdash;the least you can do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Confess to their faces, and probably
to no good? Eat the dust at their feet, and most
likely be clapped into prison for it? <i>No, thank you!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Suppose <i>I</i> went to them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. No! Why should <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Yes! Why not? They might keep
silent for <i>her</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. I would do it for my boy's sake.
Yes, <i>I'll</i> go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. <i>Yes!</i> <i>You</i> go, Blanche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. No, you <i>shan't</i> go&mdash;you shan't humiliate
yourself in his place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Certainly not; and if your husband is
willing, we are not willing! <i>He</i> must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. But if he <i>won't</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. He <i>must</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. You must demand his going, Blanche,

<p class="direction"><i>At "The Hermitage," on the Bronx River, the
next afternoon. The house is on the Left, and
on the Right and at the back are the green lattice
arches. Snow lies thick everywhere, on the
benches at the Right and on the little iron
table beside it, on the swing between two trees at
the Right, in the red boxes of dead shrubs, on
the rocks and dried grass of a "rookery" in the
centre, and on the branches of the trees.</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>
<i>comes out from the house, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Trotter</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. Come on and let mama rest awhile&mdash;naturally
she's excited and tired out, being married
so suddenly and away from home. [<i>She stops
beside the swing, taking hold of its side rope with
her hand.</i>] It isn't every mother who can elope
without her oldest child's consent and have her
youngest daughter for a bridesmaid.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Laughing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. I hope Mrs. Sterling will forgive
me. Perhaps she will when she sees how my
money can help your mother and me to get right
in with all the smarties!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. Oh, don't you be too sure about your
getting in; it isn't as easy as the papers say! But,
anyway, that wouldn't make any difference to
Blanche. She was never a climber like mama
and me. I suppose that's why she is asked to
all sorts of houses through Aunt Ruth that wouldn't
let mama and me even leave our cards on the
butler!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. I thought your mother could go
anywhere she liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. Oh, no, she couldn't! if she made you
think that, it was only a jolly! Blanche is the
only one of us who really went everywhere. Come
along, "<i>Poppa</i>," give me a swing! I haven't had
one for years!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She sweeps off the snow from the seat of the
swing with her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Your mother certainly did represent&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. [<i>Sitting in the swing.</i>] Oh, well, now
don't blame mama! She couldn't help herself;
she always thought you <i>dreadfully handsome</i>!
Swing me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. I don't care, anyway. I'm deucedly
proud of your mother,&mdash;I mean of <i>my wife</i>,&mdash;and
I'd just as lief throw up the whole society business
and go off and live happily by ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. O dear! I think mama would find
that awfully dull. Go on, swing me! [<span class="smcap">Trotter</span>
<i>swings her.</i>] Of course, you'll find mama a little
different when you see her all the time. You
really won't see much more of her, though, than you
do now. She doesn't get up till noon, and has her
masseuse for an hour every morning, her manicure
and her mental science visitor every other day,
and her face steamed three times a week! She
has to lie down a lot, too, but you mustn't mind
that; you must remember she isn't our age!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. [<i>Swings her.</i>] She <i>suits</i> me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. That's just what <i>I feel</i>! You'll take
care of her, and me, too, all our lives, and that's
what makes me so happy. I'm full of plans!
We'll go abroad soon and stay two years. [<i>He has
stopped swinging her.</i>] Go on, swing me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. [<i>Holding the swing still.</i>] Say! if
you think you are going to run me and the whole
family, you're a Dodo bird! Remember that
you're my daughter; you must wait a little if
you want to be a mother-in-law.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance, coming
nearer.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. Good gracious! If you ask <i>me</i>, I
think mama has got her hands full. What's
become of Miss Godesby and her brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. When you went upstairs with your
mother, they went down the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. You know originally the idea was <i>I</i>
was to marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Really&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. [<i>Laughingly.</i>] Yes, and mama cut me
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Oh, well, it can't be helped; we
can't marry everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. [<i>Noticing the bells.</i>] <i>Somebody else
arriving!</i> That's queer&mdash;nobody comes here
in the winter; that's why we chose it, because it
would be quiet! Let's play this game.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Going to an iron frog on a box which stands
near the house.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Perhaps it's Mrs. Sterling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. No; if she was coming at all, she'd have
come in time for the wedding. [<i>She takes up the
disks which lie beside the frog.</i>] I should hate to
get married like you and mama&mdash;no splurge and
no presents! Why, the presents'd be half the fun!
And think of all those you and she've given in
your life, and have lost now a good chance of
getting back.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Throws a disk into the frog's open mouth.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>. You talk like Jess! [<i>Throws another
disk.</i>] You know Jess earns her own living. She
goes around to smart women's houses answering
their invitations and letters for 'em. She calls it

See Mrs. Trotter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. <i>Somebody must</i>, and there's nobody
else. That boy and that mother have got to be
saved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. I'm sorry my name's no good for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. And mine mustn't be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. No, indeed! The minute that was
done, there'd be a new complication, and more
trouble would tumble down on Mrs. Sterling's
head. Good luck.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Shakes his hand and enters the house.</i></p>

kick about my wedding, have you? I wouldn't
stand for that, you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. It's not that, Mr. Trotter. Your
wife's son-in-law, Sterling, has turned out a
blackguard; he has had intrusted to him Miss
Ruth Hunter's money and several other people's,
and he's used it all for speculation of his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Then he's a damned thief!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He sits on the bench with the manner that he

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. We won't argue that, but how about
his family&mdash;they get punished for what he has
done; they must share his disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Oh, well, my wife is out of all that
now&mdash;<i>she's Mrs. Trotter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Yes, but <i>her own daughter</i> suffers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. [<i>On the defensive.</i>] She isn't very
chummy with her classy eldest daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Never mind that; you know without
my telling you that Mrs. Sterling is a fine woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. She's always snubbed me right and
left, but, by George, I must own she is a fine
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. That's right! [<i>Clapping him on the
back and putting his arm around his shoulder.</i>]
Look here&mdash;help us save her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Indorse a note of Sterling's to give
Ryder to keep him quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. I'd have to ask my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. No! Don't start off like that!
Keep the reins in your own hands at the very beginning,&mdash;make
her realize from this very day
that you're raised up on the cushion beside her;
that she's sitting lower down admiring the scenery,
while you do the driving through life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. [<i>Half laughing.</i>] Ha! I guess
you're right. Box seat and reins are good enough
for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Good boy! Then we can count on
you to sign this note?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Where's <i>my</i> security?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I can get you security if you want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. Of course I want it! And I say,
where are <i>you</i>? Why aren't <i>you</i> in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. There are reasons why my name
had better not appear; you are in the family.
But I'll tell you what I'll do, Trotter; I'll secure
<i>you</i> with a note of my own&mdash;only you must keep
it dark; you mustn't even let Mason know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span>. All right, perhaps I'm a Dodo bird,
but I'll do it. Say, I seem to have married a
good many of this classy family!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Why didn't you give him to <i>me</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I felt you would be willing, out of

that Blanche Sterling will have to come off her

Dick, who'd been out&mdash;</p>

myself to get him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Godesby</span>. How do you feel about him now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Now! Thank God, I'm saved

<p class="direction">[<i>Sleigh-bells start up loud and die off quickly;</i>

out of each other. This is the case,&mdash;I trusted
this man with my affairs. He was very attractive&mdash;I
don't deny that; business with Dick Sterling
became more or less of a pleasure&mdash;but that
doesn't cut any ice with me; he's stolen my
money. To put it plainly, he's a common thief,
and he ought to be punished; why should he go
scot free and a lot of others not? You know
perfectly well his note wouldn't be worth the paper
it was written on; and, anyway, if he hasn't gone
and sneaked out of the world, I won't lift my little
finger to keep him from the punishment he deserves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Godesby</span>. Good for you, Julia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Don't you put your oar in, Godesby;
just let this matter rest between your sister and
me! She's always been known as the best man
in your family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Godesby</span>. You don't choose a very conciliatory
way of bringing us around!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I'm not choosing any way at all; I'm
striking right out from the shoulder. There
isn't time for beating round the bush! I'm
pleading for the good name and honorable position
of a perfectly innocent, a fine, woman, and for
the reputation and unimpeded career of her son!
And I make that appeal as man to man and
woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. I have nothing to do with
any one in this matter but Sterling himself, who
has robbed me, and I'll gladly see him suffer for it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Now look here, Miss Godesby, you
belong to a pretty tough crowd in society, but I
know at heart you're not a bad sort! What good
will it do you? Granted even that you don't care
for Mrs. Sterling, still don't tell me you're the kind
of woman to take a cruel pleasure in seeing another
woman suffer! I wouldn't believe it! You're
not one of those catty creatures! You're a clever
woman, and I don't doubt you can be a pretty
hard one, too, at times; but you're <i>just</i>&mdash;that's
the point now&mdash;you're <i><span class="smcap">just</span></i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Exactly! I'm
just, an eye for an eye! Sterling is a thief, let
him get the deserts of one!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She sits on the bench determinedly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. But you can't look at only one
side! You can't shut your eyes to his wife's

does her boy deserve to share his disgrace. [<i>He
sits beside her.</i>] Why, you have it in your power
to handicap that boy through his whole life by
publishing his father a criminal; or you can give
that boy a fair show to prove himself more his
<i>mother's son</i> than his father's, and to live an
honest&mdash;who knows&mdash;perhaps a noble life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. I refuse to accept such a responsibility.

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Rises, interrupting her.</i>] Ryder's word

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Well, that's <i>his</i> lookout.</p>

I'll bet you! You'll have to run across the results
of the harm you do to Mrs. Sterling and Richard
day in and day out, year after year! I don't
believe you realize what it means! Why, I know

of a little dog in your arms, afraid lest he'd get
into the hands of the vivisectionists, and yet here
you'll let a boy and his mother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Godesby</span>. Stick to that, Julia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I shan't try to persuade her against
that. Will you leave your sister alone with me a
moment. Perhaps you'll see about your sleigh
being ready to return to town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Godesby</span>. I've no objection&mdash;if Julia wishes it.</p>

it; that will only make it seem worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Well, suppose I were in love with her&mdash;what
of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Godesby</span>. Nothing; only, my dear Warden,
that woman&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Interrupts.</i>] Wait a minute! You've
got me in a corner, but knowing half the truth,
you mustn't <i>guess</i> the whole. She is even more ignorant

satirical exclamation.</i>] You don't believe that,
but I'll <i>make</i> you. I'm going to tell <i>you</i> something
I've never even told myself. I'm going
to put you to a big test, because I've got to.
Apparently, I can't help myself; but after all,
somehow I believe in the human nature in you,

<p><span class="smcap">Warden.</span> I am, and I <i>love her</i>. But surely the
silent love of a man, like mine, is no insult to a

any one, except, perhaps, the one who loves. You
must acknowledge even <i>you</i> have never heard
a hint; you <i>showed</i> just now your real surprise at
what circumstances revealed to you! I'd die
sooner than bring the slightest shadow of a scandal
on her, and I've hugged my secret tight. Have
you any idea what such a love means? How it
grows and grows, its strength shut in, held back,
doubling and redoubling its powers!&mdash;its ideality
increasing, the passion <i>suppressed</i>, locked up!

my head would burst in one of these close little
rooms. Have you seen mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. No, not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Where is Dick? Did he go to
Ryder's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. No, but I have some good news to
tell you all the same&mdash;Ryder has promised silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>With tremendous relief.</i>] Oh! that's
too good, too good to be true! To whom did he
promise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. I want you not to ask me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. I can guess, it was&mdash;</p>

silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. You're sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. We have their word!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>Pointedly.</i>] Mr. Mason again?&mdash;</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Warden</span> <i>bows his head in assent.</i>] He was <i>here</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Some time ago, but only for a minute.
He didn't stay; he went to find your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. But the <i>Godesbys</i>? I just met
them now on the road going back. How could
Mr. Mason, if he didn't stay&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Warden</span> <i>is

library; a warm, livable, and lovable room, full
of pictures, photographs, and books; mistletoe
and holly decorate everywhere. In the bow-window
at back there is a large bird-cage with
half a dozen birds in it. The furniture is
comfortable and heavily upholstered. At Left
there is a fireplace with logs ready, but the fire is
not lit. There a big table near the centre, full of
magazines, illustrated papers, and books. A big
arm-chair is beside the table, and other chairs
conversationally close. There is a table near the
door at Right, piled with Christmas gifts, still
wrapped in white paper; they are tied with many
colored ribbons and bunches of holly. There are
doors Right and Left. After the curtain rises on
an empty stage,</i> <span class="smcap">Ruth</span> <i>enters quickly; while she
has her buoyant manner, she is, of course, more
serious than usual. She carries a bunch of fresh
violets in her hand. She looks about the room with
a sort of curiosity. She is waiting for some one
to appear. She takes up a silver-framed photograph
of her brother which stands on a table
and speaks aloud to it.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I'm glad you're spared this. [<i>With a
long-drawn breath she places the photograph back
upon the table and turns to greet</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, <i>who

help me decide, only <i>you</i> can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Have you seen your husband this
morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> No. He sent word he was feeling

now and to cut my life free, entirely, from Dick's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> You used to agree with me. I've heard
you decry these snapshot, rapid-transit, tunnel
divorces many a time. I've heard you say when
a woman has made her bed, she must lie in it&mdash;make
the best of her bad bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> I always sympathized with a woman

any innuendoes at Mr. Trotter; it's he who said
it was my duty to stand by you, advise you, and
all that sort of thing. I'm not here to please

a very pleasant place to spend your honeymoon!</p>

Polygamy?</p>

you <i>did</i>, didn't you, Blanche?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span>. I loved the man I thought you were.
Do you remember that day in the mountains when
we first really came to know each other, when we
walked many, many miles without dreaming of
being tired?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling.</span> And found ourselves at sunset at the
top instead of below, by our hotel! Oh, yes, I
remember! The world changed for me that day.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He sinks back into the arm-chair, overcome, in
his weakened state, by his memories and his

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> And for me! I knew then for the
first time you loved me, and that I loved you. Oh!
how short life of a sudden seemed! Not half
long enough for the happiness it held for me!
[<i>She turns upon him with a vivid change of feeling.</i>]
Has it turned out so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling.</span> How different! Oh, what a beast!
what a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> [<i>Speaking with pathetic emotion,
tears in her throat and in her eyes.</i>] And that
early summer's day you asked me to be your wife!
[<i>She gives a little exclamation, half a sob, half a
laugh.</i>] It was in the corner of the garden; I can
smell the lilacs now! And the raindrops fell
from the branches as my happy tears did on
father's shoulder that night, when I said, "Father,
he will make me the happiest woman in the world!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling.</span> O God! to have your love back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> You can't breathe life back into a
dead thing; how different the world would be if
one could!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling.</span> You can bring back life to the
drowned; perhaps your love is only drowned in
the sorrow I've caused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> [<i>Smiles sadly and shakes her head;
the smile dies away.</i>] Life to me then was like a
glorious staircase, and I mounted happy step after
step led by your hand till everything <i>seemed</i> to
culminate on the day of our wedding. You men
don't, <i>can't</i> realize, what that service means to a
girl. In those few moments she parts from all
that have cherished her, made her life, and gives
her whole self, her love, her body, and even her
soul sometimes&mdash;for love often overwhelms us
women&mdash;to <i>the</i> man who, she believes, wants,
<i>starves</i>, for her gifts. All that a woman who
marries for love feels at the altar I tell you a <i>man</i>
can't understand! You treated this gift of mine,
Dick, like a child does a Santa Claus plaything&mdash;for
a while you were never happy away from it,
then you grew accustomed to it, then you broke
it, and now you have even lost the broken pieces!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. [<i>Comes to her, growing more and more
determined.</i>] I will <i>find</i> them, and put them
together again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. [<i>Again smiles sadly and shakes her
head.</i>] First we made of <i>every Tuesday</i> a festival&mdash;our
wedding anniversary. After a while we kept
the twenty-eighth of <i>every month</i>! The second
year you were satisfied with the twenty-eighth of
April only, and last year you forgot the day altogether.
And yet what a happy first year it was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Ah, you see I <i>did</i> make you happy
once!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>. Blessedly happy! Our long silences
in those days were not broken by an oath and a
fling out of the room. Oh, the happiness it means
to a wife to see it is hard for her husband to leave
her in the morning, and to be taken so quickly&mdash;even
roughly&mdash;into his arms at night that she
knows he has been longing to come back to her.
Nothing grew tame that first year. And at its end I
climbed to the highest step I had reached yet, when
you leaned over my bed and cried big man's tears,
the first I'd ever seen you cry, and kissed me first,
and then little Richard lying on my warm arm, and
said, "God bless you, little mother." [<i>There is a
pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>cries softly a moment.</i> <span class="smcap">Sterling</span>

past, but Richard's my boy. I'll make him proud

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. I have a message for you from my
wife. [<i>There is a second's pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Warden</span> <i>stops
whistling and turns and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Sterling</span>.] She

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Yes?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Anxious, at a supreme tension, and now a little

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. <i>Ever!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Losing his control.</i>] That's a lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. I couldn't believe it, either, when she
told me. It was her first word to me to-day. I
said, "You are going to divorce me," and she
answered, "No."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. She's sacrificing herself for some
reason&mdash;her boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Never mind, she won't leave me;
I have her promise, and I'll win back her love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. You fool! You can't win her back!
She would never have loved me if you hadn't
disillusioned, <i>dishonored</i> her! I'm not worthy of
her, but I'll never dishonor her, and, please God,
never disappoint her, and so I'll keep her love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Well, as to that, she decides to stay,
leaving love out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. And you'll accept that sacrifice!
You don't even <i>love</i> her. You're only thinking
of <i>yourself</i> now. Love, real love, forgets itself.
You, after having spoilt half her life, are willing
to spoil the rest, for <i>your own sake</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. No, for the boy's sake, and her
sake&mdash;to save a scandal&mdash;the world&mdash;</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Beside himself.</i>] Oh, damn the world!
It's <i>heaven</i> and <i>hell</i> you'd better think of. <i>Scandal!</i>
It couldn't harm <i>her</i>, and the hurt it would do you
is a small price to pay. Those whom <i>God</i> has
joined&mdash;yes! but it was the devil bound her to
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Here! I've had enough! Look
out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Moves toward him.</i>] <i>You</i> look out&mdash;you
shan't rob her of her happiness. You&mdash;a

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. <i>I'd keep her now if only to spite you!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Hah! There spoke the true man in
you! Would to heaven the old days of duelling
were back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. A brave wish, as you know they're
not!</p>

you out of her way for good. Will you fight?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Coming closer to him.</i></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>There is no response.</i> <span class="smcap">Warden</span> <i>is with great

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. What's the trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. I have just told Warden my wife's

will! I <i>will</i>&mdash;I tell you all! I hardly know what
I say or do! But look out for me, I'm desperate!
I'm a torrent that's only let loose since yesterday,
and now all of a sudden you try to stop me! But
it's too late; I've got my impetus; the repressed
passion of years is behind me; nothing can stop
me&mdash;and God keep me from doing the wrong
thing! I am determined to clear him out of the
way of the happiness of the woman I love. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Ruth</span>.] Do you mean to say you approve of her
decision? [<span class="smcap">Ruth</span> <i>turns her head; he turns to</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. No.</p>

You will stand by me, Aunt Ruth, and together
we&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. [<i>Interrupting and refusing his hand.</i>]
Oh, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>. No. It would be useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason</span>. Decide well&mdash;</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He hesitates a moment and then goes out Right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. [<i>Watching him go.</i>] There's not
one soul in this world who cares for me, and it's
my <i>own fault</i>. [<span class="smcap">Richard</span> <i>is heard upstairs again
singing "Once in Royal David's City.</i>" <span class="smcap">Sterling</span>

loves me, and it would be better for him, too, if I
went away. I'll go to sleep and see how I feel
about it when I wake up. [<i>He moves the glass of
water and takes out the box of tablets. He starts
suddenly, but very slightly, and his muscles tighten.</i>]</p>

<p>After all, why not end it all <i>now</i>, at once, without
any more bother? [<i>He looks in the box, and glances
up questioningly; then he remembers the fireplace
where he threw the other tablets and looks across the
room at the logs. He rises, goes over, and sees in the
fireplace the twisted envelope which holds the other
tablets. He bends over to pick it up; he stops
short.</i>] No! Why shouldn't I try it, anyway?
She, herself, gives me the chance! [<i>He rings the
electric bell, and walking away from the fireplace,
takes up with a trembling hand the papers left by</i>
<span class="smcap">Mason</span>; <i>he wipes the damp from his forehead with
his handkerchief. To</i> <span class="smcap">Jordan</span>, <i>who enters Left.</i>]
Light the fire quickly; I feel cold.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He sinks into the arm-chair, weak from the
mental strain.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. It's very warm in the house, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Do as I tell you&mdash;light the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. [<i>Looking for matches on the mantel,
finds the box empty.</i>] There are no matches, sir;
I must get one.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He gives him a match from his own box.</i>

glances up, but quickly looks back to his
work and strikes a match. The match goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. I shall need another match, please,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. [<i>With one in his fingers taken from
his match-box, he alters his mind.</i>] I have no more.
[<i>He puts away his match-box.</i>] Never mind the
fire; get me a pint bottle of champagne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>. [<i>With a surreptitious side glance of
curiosity.</i>] Very well, sir.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He goes out Left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. That was funny; that was very
funny! I wonder if it was accident, or if there's
such a thing as fatality. [<i>He goes to the fireplace
and picks up the twisted envelope.</i>] If not now&mdash;perhaps
some other time&mdash;who knows? [<i>He
thrusts the envelope in his vest pocket, and takes up
the papers again from the table to look over them.</i>]
I can't read these things! [<i>Throwing them down.</i>]
The words mean nothing to me!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>There is the sound outside of a cork being drawn.</i>
<span class="smcap">Leonard</span> <i>enters with the champagne and a
glass and places them beside</i> <span class="smcap">Sterling</span>.</p>

aloud.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. One, two, three, four&mdash;[<i>He puts
all in the glass, dropping them as he counts. He
hesitates, then quickly drops in two more and drinks
quickly. The glass is empty. He sits by the table
thinking a moment, then lakes a piece of paper
and makes ready his stylographic pen.</i>] Let me see;
can I make it seem accidental; it would be so
much less bother and trouble for them! [<i>He
thinks a second, then writes.</i>] "I have accidentally
taken an overdose of my sleeping draught. I have
tried to call some one, but it's no use. I ask only
one thing, that you forget all my sins, wipe out
their memory with my name. I want my boy to
change his name, too." [<i>He hesitates a moment,
and then scratches that sentence heavily out.</i>] No,
I won't say that. [<i>He waits a moment.</i>] God in
heaven, what wouldn't I give for one friendly
word just now! Some one to sort of say <i>good-by</i>
to me&mdash;take my hand&mdash;even a <i>servant</i>!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He looks about him, showing signs of drowsiness.

the matter&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. Nothing&mdash;I'm half asleep, that's
all&mdash;the reaction&mdash;I'm worn out and I've changed
my mind&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. I'm going away for good&mdash;that's
the best I can do; I want you to forgive me&mdash;<i>could</i>
you? What do you say? Forgive me for everything!
For the sake of the old schoolboy days&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. When are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. To-day. Will you say good-by to
me and wish me well on my journey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Speaks without sympathy.</i>] You can
count on me always to help you in any way I can.
You can still retrieve a good deal if you're strong
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. I know what a beastly friend I've
been, and yesterday was more than any man would
stand, but forgive that, too, will you? I've always
been a bad lot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. [<i>Goes to him and speaks, with the
sympathy of a man for a child coming into his voice.</i>]
No, a weak lot; that's been your ruin, Dickie.
I'll see you again before you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterling</span>. No, I'm going to sleep as long as I
can now, and I don't want any one to wake me
up; but when I do wake, I shall have other things
to do. This is good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warden</span>. Well, good luck! [<i>He starts to go.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
